## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You should have a good understanding of all the foundational topics and a high-level understanding of [Ethereum scaling](/developers/docs/scaling/). Implementing scaling solutions such as rollups is an advanced topic as the technology is less battle-tested and continues to be researched and developed.

## Zero-knowledge rollups {#zk-rollups}

**Zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups)** bundle (or "roll-up") hundreds of transfers off-chain and generate a cryptographic proof. These proofs can come in the form of SNARKs (succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge) or STARKs (scalable transparent argument of knowledge). SNARKs and STARKs are known as validity proofs and get posted to layer 1.

The ZK-rollup smart contract maintains the state of all transfers on layer 2, and this state can only be updated with a validity proof. This means that ZK-rollups only need the validity proof instead of all transaction data. With a ZK-rollup, validating a block is quicker and cheaper because less data is included.

With a ZK-rollup, there are no delays when moving funds from layer 2 to layer 1 because a validity proof accepted by the ZK-rollup contract has already verified the funds.

Being on layer 2, ZK-rollups can be optimised to reduce transaction size further. For instance, an account is represented by an index rather than an address, which reduces a transaction from 32 bytes to just 4 bytes. Transactions are also written to Ethereum as `calldata`, reducing gas.

### Pros and cons {#zk-pros-and-cons}

| Pros                                                                                                              | Cons                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Faster finality time since the state is instantly verified once the proofs are sent to the main chain.            | Some don't have EVM support.                                                                          |
| Not vulnerable to the economic attacks that [Optimistic rollups](#optimistic-pros-and-cons) can be vulnerable to. | Validity proofs are intense to compute â€“ not worth it for applications with little on-chain activity. |
| Secure and decentralized, since the data that is needed to recover the state is stored on the layer 1 chain.      | An operator can influence transaction ordering                                                        |
